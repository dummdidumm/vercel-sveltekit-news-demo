# SvelteKit + Vercel News-Style Demo

A SvelteKit "news" site running on Vercel. Showcasing the following features:

- Rendering modes: `/about` page is prerendered, home page is server-side-rendered, `/admin` page is an SPA, articles use Vercel ISR
- Articles are ISR'd, with the possibility to refresh their "Last updated" timestamp (i.e. regenerate the articles) using the hidden `/admin` page
- Vercel Toolbar: Visible during local development and on preview deployments. Contains a flag for making the the headlines on the home page bigger

Deployed to production at https://vercel-sveltekit-news-demo.vercel.app/
